## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first development
- Flexbox
- Sass
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to build a little counter with some of the JavaScript knowledge I studied upfront, especially how to dynamically add elements and how to handle events like click and keydown.

### Continued development

This project could be part of a bigger one, so it could be useful in future 

### Useful resources

- [Habitica](https://habitica.com/): it's a platform that is helping me tracking my tasks and habits. In particular, I was inspired by the habit counters to build this project
